# kubernetes-gitlab-demo
This work is based  partially on: https://github.com/lwolf/kubernetes-gitlab/. GitLab would like to thank Sergey Nuzhdin for his work.

This series of manifests are provided in a templated manner, for the deployment
and testing of [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) via [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/). These templates are used in the GitLab Idea to Production demo on GKE

Terms:

-  Google Cloud Platform (**GCP**)
-  Google Container Engine (**GKE**)
-  Kubernetes (**k8s**)

Contents:

-  Manifest YAML for all objects needed by GKE
-  Generation script to combine them into a single YAML, after customizing IP, domain, and email per-deployment

Requirements:

-  [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) account. This can be a trial, or paid account. The trial has lower limitations, so extensive
testing with GitLab's Review Apps feature may exceed those limitations.
-  [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) for using `gcloud` commands. This SDK also includes the necessary `kubectl` utilities.
-  Access to a `bash` shell. It is recommended at this time to use a GNU/Linux-based or OSX operating system.
-  Access to the internet via HTTPS traffic.


# Deploying GitLab CE with GKE & k8s

These instructions will bring up a fully functional GitLab CE instance on GKE.

Features included in this deployment:

- GitLab CE
- Mattermost with Chat-Ops integration
- Integrated local Docker Registry
- GitLab Multi-runner
- ReviewApps deployment through k8s, as part of the same GKE cluster
- Prometheus monitoring of GitLab server
- Fully integrated [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for all components, environments, and deployments

Steps:

1.  Fetch templates
1.  Create a GKE cluster
1.  Reserve a Static IP in GCP
1.  Register a DNS Entry
1.  Generate your configuration
1.  Connect to cluster via `gcloud`
1.  Deploy via `kubectl`

## Fetch templates

[This repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/kubernetes-gitlab-demo) contains a total of 24 YAML files, and a `generate.bash` script which will combine these into one, and translate placeholder values to the values you provide in later steps.

## Create a GKE cluster

Login to [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and navigate to Compute > [Container Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes) via the menu, or follow the link directly. Here, we will use the `+ Create Cluster` button to create a new cluster for deploying GitLab.

You can name this cluster how you see fit, and place it in any *Zone* that you wish. It is suggested that the cluster be made up of at least 3 nodes, and that the *Machine type* include at least 2 vCPU for performance reasons.

As you make this cluster, take note of the *Zone* that it is created it, as we will need this for the create of the Static IP inthe next step.

## Reserve a Static IP in GCP

Navigate to Compute > [Networking](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking) via the navigation menu, or follow the link directly. Here, we will reserve the Static IP address that the deployed GitLab instance will use for Ingress control. This step is very important because of the requirement for the Domain Name Service to be able to consitently resolve, and allow Let's Encrypt integration across all services.

Once on the Networking page of GCP, navigate to `External IP addresses`, and use the `+ Reserve Static Address` button. You may supply any name you wish here, as this is not a host name but a descriptor. For this, be sure to the the *Region* to that which includes the *Zone* used when creating the GKE cluster. If you selected `us-central1-b`, your *Region* would be `us-central1`. Once the necessary fields are complete, click `Reserve`.

Once the process has completed, you will be returned to the `External IP Addresses` page, and will find a new entry with your newly reserved, but unused Static IP Address. Make note of this, as it will be used in the next step.

## Register a DNS Entry

Once you have completed the previous step, it is now time to ensure that you have a valid DNS entry for the GitLab deployment. This [A Record](https://support.google.com/a/answer/48090?hl=en#H) should be a [wildcard](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/4633759?hl=en) entry, so that all forms of subdomains will point to your Ingress point within the GKE cluster.

Due to the number of possible DNS providers and services that are possible to be used here, we will not cover the exact specifics for any one provider.

For best reliability, it is highly recommended to **not use** a service such as [xip.io](https://xip.io) because Let's Encrypt enforces a [rate limit](http://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) on toplevel domains, and you are likely to have a *very sub-par* experience.

## Generate your configuration

After configuring static IP and setting up DNS Entry you now need to generate YAML file with configuration that uses both.

To do that just run following command:

```shell
GITLAB_LEGO_EMAIL=email@example.com \
GITLAB_GKE_IP=100.10.20.30 \
GITLAB_GKE_DOMAIN=k8s.example.com \
bash generate.bash
```
Where:
* *GITLAB_LEGO_EMAIL* - Let's Encrypt registration and recovery contact
* *GITLAB_GKE_IP* - static IP configured in previous steps.
* *GITLAB_GKE_DOMAIN* - DNS entry configured previously (but without actual wildcard).

This command will generate YAML file with your GitLab cluster configuration. For our example domain the filename will be `gitlab-k8s-example-com.yml`

## Connect to cluster via `gcloud`

To apply the configuration to Kubernetes cluster you first need to configure your kubectl cmdline tool to connect to proper cluster.

Go to following GKE page [Cluster List](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list), find your cluster. Click *Connect* button that is just besides your cluster name. From window that will pop up copy the gcloud command that will be shown and execute in your terminal.
This command will configure your local kubernetes command line client.

The command should look similar to following:
```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> \
    --zone <availability-zone> --project <project-id>
```

## Deploy via `kubectl`

Once you have everthing configured you can deploy the GitLab to your Kubernetes cluster by invoking following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f <generated-configuration-filename>
```

All necessary components will start deploying to your cluster. You can track the progress of that by going to Kubernetes Dashboard of the cluster. One example way to do this is to launch
```shell
kubectl proxy
```

And then you can access your dashboard by going to [http://localhost:8001/ui](http://localhost:8001/ui).

Once your cluster finishes deploying you will be able to access your new GitLab installation by going to

```
https://gitlab.<wildcard-dns-entry>/
```

## Monitoring with Prometheus

After GitLab is up and running, you will be able to connect to the Prometheus console to view the metrics that are collected. To connect to the Prometheus server, open:

```
https://prometheus.<wildcard-dns-entry>/
```

It will monitor the system resources of the GitLab container, providing insight into metrics like CPU, memory, and throughput.

Sample Prometheus queries:
* % Memory Used: `(1 - ((node_memory_MemFree + node_memory_Cached) / node_memory_MemTotal)) * 100`
* % CPU Load: `1 - rate(node_cpu{mode="idle"}[5m])`
* Data Transmitted: `irate(node_network_transmit_bytes[5m])`
* Data Received: `irate(node_network_receive_bytes[5m])`

# Upgrading to a new version

Upgrading your Kubernetes deployment of GitLab proves to be quite simple.

* Fetch the latest `master` with `git checkout master && git pull`
* Re-run the `generate.bash` with the same variables originally used.
* Apply the updates YAML with `kubectl apply -f gitlab-{domain}.yml`
